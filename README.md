Here are some data manipulation with Python Libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlip, and Numpy.
in the Juputer notebook I have loaded the data, described it, and visualize it
this project is part of a Udemy machine Learning Course.

And Here are some information from Wikipidiea about the dataset itself:
"The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis."
